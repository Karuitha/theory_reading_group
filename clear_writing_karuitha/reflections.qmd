## **Background**

-   Writing is hard work.

-   Writing can be frustrating, more so for theory papers.

-   Gets worse with journal rejections comments.

    -   *I am not sure what the author wanted to achieve in this paper...*

    -   *After reading the paper thrice, I am still not sure what it is all about.*

    -   *The first 10 pages were an endless literature review.*

## **Objectives**

-   The key to clear writing is to understand the reader [@editors2012; @williams2014lessons; @zinsser2006writing].

-   This is more easily said than done.

-   The goals of this article are:

    -   Share reviewers insights and reflections on clear writing.

    -   Add to the topic of clear writing which is key in all areas, and especially academia.

## Method

-   The editor interviewed current and past editorial review members of AMR.

-   The author engaged the subjects on the following issues in the survey:

    -   Input on writing styles, organisation, and presentation of theory papers.

    -   Thoughts on why authors engage in poor writing.

    -   Advice and recommendations on writing clear theoretical articles.

## What is Clear Writing?

-   Clear writing commits to express ideas with;

    -   Clarity,

    -   Directness,

    -   Precision.

-   Clear writing is elegant, not pretentious.

-   The goal is not to show readers how smart you are.

-   The goal is to take the reader on a clear, logical, and direct journey.

## What is Clear Writing?

-   Clear writing is simple but not simplistic.

-   Clear writing points the readers to the key points and logic without having to re-read the content.

-   Clear writing focuses on the reader, not the writer.

-   In fact, clear writing keeps the writer invisible as the message passes across.

## **What Makes Writing Bad?**

### Foggy Writing

-   Use of complex words that obscure meaning.

-   Using complex language/ dense sentences for straight forward concepts.

-   Using more than one term without prior clarification.

-   Use of passive language --- big issue. Difficult on the mind as the reader has to figure out who is doing what.

## **What Makes Writing Bad?**

### Why Do Authors Foggy Write?

-   Writing to "IMPRESS" rather than "EXPRESS".

-   Position your idea as novel by describing it differently.

-   Afraid to reveal how simple our ideas are; feels devaluing. There is beauty in simplicity.

-   Insecurities, misconceptions about writing,

-   Lack of clarity in their mind about what they are writing.

## **What Makes Writing Bad?**

### Remedies to Foggy Writing

-   Dissect your ideas to the core and present them with minimum jargon.

-   Knowing what you really want to say helps in writing clarity.

-   Get a reviewer that will be VERY honest about your writing. This requires putting our EGO aside.

## Read my Mind

-   Cousin of foggy writing.

-   Presenting the reader with concepts, jargon, and acronyms that are undefined or used inconsistently in the article.

-   Assuming that the reader is inside your (the writer) mind.

-   Use of un-neccesary jargon and incomprehensible text.

-   Its like readers need to learn a new language to follow your text.

## Read my Mind

### What Causes the Read my Mind Problem?

-   Lack of empathy and perspective. Put yourself in the readers shoes.

-   Being too close to the subject (expert-wise). You assume others grasp it as well as you do.

-   Self serving purpose: If I don't define this term, there is less risk of criticism.

-   If I keep the definitions ambiguous, I can stretch them at will.

## Read my Mind

### Remedies

-   Never lose site of your reader.

-   Have a non-specialist read your work. If they can't follow, it is too complex.

-   Read aloud the text with your co-author, friend. This also catches typos. Text reading software can help.

-   Introduce jargon for 2 to 5 concepts. For other jargon, just include their relevant context.

-   Leave your paper for a few days then reread it. If you struggle to understand any part, your reader won't get it either.

## What is the Story?

-   A clear story is clear, direct, and compelling.

-   A clear, direct, and compelling story hooks the reader and carries them to the end without struggle.

-   In contrast, bad writing is fragmented, has no thread, and tells no story. What causes this? Next ........

## What is the Story?

### Causes

-   Bad introductions. The key to a clear, compelling story is a good introduction.

-   A good introduction should;

    -   Tell the story in a nutshell.

    -   Embed the paper in its research context.

    -   Explain the contribution of the paper to the literature.

    -   Draw the reader to the story (hook the reader).

## What is the Story?

### Causes

-   Failing to 'problematize' the literature.

-   "Problematization" is the core to justifying your write up.

-   Answer the question, "Without this work, what can't we understand"?

-   Stating that a gap exists is not enough. Not all gaps need to be filled.

-   STATE YOUR CONTRIBUTION EARLY. Hint it in the first paragraph and present it more broadly within the first few pages.

## What is the Story?

### Causes

-   Too many cooks in the kitchen. Sharing out different paper sections to different authors.

-   Trying to do too much in one manuscript. Scope your work realistically.

-   Give your paper to a non-specialist to read and then ask them what the story is about. If they cant state in simple terms, there is a problem.

## **Conclusion**

-   Clear writing reflects a clear thought process.

-   Striving to write clearly invokes thinking.

-   Do not write to impress. Write to express.

-   Keep it simple.

-   Present your intent early. Research article is not a suspense novel.

## **Conclusion**

-   Be keen on the introduction.

-   Minimize of eliminate passive language. Always active.

-   Have your work read by specialists and non-specialists before submission for publication.

-   Always give an outline of the study.

## **Conclusion**

-   Read the topic sentence of each paragraph alone to gauge the progress.

-   Write the entire story line as bullets on one page, ensuring that the different key terms and relations cover the main aspects and are related in a logical, sequential way.

-   Go back and justify the need for each para\[graphs\] written. This forces you to make connections between the different ideas in the paper and develop a good map of the overall landscape--which then helps the reader and makes it easy for them to follow your thought process.
